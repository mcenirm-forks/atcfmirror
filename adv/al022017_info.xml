moving toward the west-northwest near 21 mph (33 km/h), and this

move across the southeastern Caribbean Sea today.

Surface observations from the eastern Caribbean Sea indicate that
the maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher
gusts. Little change in strength is forecast today, and a weakening
trend is expected to begin later today and Bret is forecast to
become a tropical depression on Wednesday.

Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles (205 km)
primarily to the north of the center.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1008 mb (29.77 inches).
